#What was my motivation? 

My motivation was to make the user find the information that they would need with ease. Also based on whatever platform the user was accessing the website, all the appropriate information  was available for them.   

#Why did you build this project? 

I built this project to earn experience and further my knowledge in Semantic HTML, as well as intermediate CSS. After completing the project, I became more prepared for the industry as a Front-End Web Developer.   

#How to get the development running?  

In order to get this development running, I first examined the website from a consumer's point of view. Seeing the website and experiencing the consumer's experience, made me justify what needed to be done in order to  enhance the accessibility of the site. From there, I looked at the overall structure of the HTML, cleaning the code and making it easier for me to navigate through as I made the necessary changes. Once the changes were made to the HTML, I then looked at  the CSS Style Sheet to make the appropriate changes to the website's capabilities when viewing it through either a desktop, tablet, or mobile.   

#Provide instructions and examples for use?  

Based on the knowledge I gathered while completing this project, this experience can be applied to any E-commerce platform that wanted to reach a large demographic and wide ranged age group. If a consumer is satisfied when navigating through your website and they were able to find the information that they needed, then this development through its HTML and CSS was necessary.
